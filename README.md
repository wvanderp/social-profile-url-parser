# Social Profile URL Parser

The `Social Profile URL Parser` is a Node.js library that allows you to extract social media profile URLs from a block of text. It is useful for situations where you have a large amount of text that contains multiple social media profile links and you want to extract and organize them in a structured way.

To use the library, you can simply pass in a string of text and the library will return an array of objects containing the social media platform name, profile URL, and username for each link found. You can also specify which platforms you want to extract links for by passing in an array of platform names.

The library supports a wide range of popular social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and more. It is easy to use and can save you a lot of time and effort when working with large amounts of text containing social media profile links.
